In this document, by viewing an introduction to the usage of blockchain in medical information exchanging and an article about the concerns,I discussed the implementation of blockchain tech during pandemic and the challenge it confronts.


## article 1
In Remko Van Hoek and Mary Lacity's [How the Pandemic Is Pushing Blockchain Forward](https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-the-pandemic-is-pushing-blockchain-forward).
They examed the urgence of updating the data sharing among the production of medical instrument, by raising the example of a tech startup Tymlez. The company is partnering with the Dutch government in a technology consortium, using its network modelling technology to map and analyze the medical supply chain. 

The power of blockchain is the ability to share data without revealing personal information.The virus has revealed the weaknesses in our supply chains, our inability to deploy resources where they are most needed to address the pandemic, and difficulties in capturing and sharing the data needed to make rapid decisions in managing it. While blockchain was developed for finance trading at the very beginning, its feature of security and efficience pushed forward its implementation in worldwide issues.



## article 2 
In Manish Laxmikant Naik's [Dealing with a Pandemic using Blockchain](https://blogs.infosys.com/infosys-cobalt/digital-supply-chain/dealing-with-a-pandemic-using-blockchain-point-of-view.html). While the previous article articulates the benefits of pushing blockchain in pandemic, this article raised some concerns.  It calls for a lot of groundwork, development and standardization. A lot of issues about the cost, unification among distinct government and standards are waiting for solution.

Moreover, as the blockchain system need to base on the internet, a penetration of internet plays an important role here. It raised challenge to the infrastructure that the components of such server network also have to be potent enough.And as the wroldwide data is enumerous, this implies the ability to access information across blockchains without any special provisions. Interoperability is one of the most important steps in blockchainâ€™s mass adoption and evolution.
